# orgchart
Simple example of organization chart for dynamic organization 

Project inspired by my inquiry [tweet](https://twitter.com/paulwillgamble/status/1214589845277945858?s=20).

Within my organization I have to be "granted" permission to use the entreprise software: "OrgPublisher" by peoplefluent.

Meh.

I think something public and online using the [GC directory](gcdirectory-gcannuaire.ssc-spc.gc.ca/) can be created.
